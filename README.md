# Linear Programming Visualization of Feasible Polyhedron

This project is designed to help students understand the concept of the feasible set in Linear Programming (LP). The code solves a linear programming problem and visualizes the feasible region along with the optimal solution using a 3D scatter plot. This project was created as part of a course activity (CA) for the Linear Programming course taught by Dr. Amin Ghodousian.

# Introduction
Linear programming is a mathematical technique for maximizing or minimizing a linear objective function, subject to a set of linear inequality or equality constraints. This project demonstrates how to solve a linear programming problem and visualize the feasible polyhedron using Python libraries numpy, scipy.optimize, and plotly.

# Code Explanation
## Objective Function
The objective function is defined with the coefficients c. The problem is set up for maximization by negating the coefficients
## Constraints
The constraints are defined by the matrix A and the vector b
## Visualization
A 3D scatter plot is created using plotly to visualize the feasible region and the optimal solution
